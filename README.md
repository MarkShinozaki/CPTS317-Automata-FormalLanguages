### Overview
#### Details of the Tasks:

#### 1, Languages Definition:

- L1: Consists of all words containing at least three 'a's.
- L2: Consists of all words with an equal number of 'a's and 'b's.

#### 2. Robot Programming:

- The student is tasked to program a hypothetical robot, M, which can show one of two flowers (red for 'a' and blue for 'b') at each second. The programming must ensure the robot's observable behaviors (flower showing sequences) match the conditions of languages L1 and L2 respectively.

**Task 1**: Program the robot so that its behavior fits the description of L1.

**Task 2**: Program the robot so that its behavior matches L2.

#### 3. Memory Usage Argument:
- Task 3: Discuss intuitively why a fixed and finite amount of memory is sufficient for programming the robot for L1, while an unbounded memory is necessary for L2. This part of the homework focuses on understanding how memory requirements change with the complexity of the task a machine (or automaton) needs to perform.

#### 4. Complexity Comparison:

- Task 4: Despite concluding from Task 3 that L2 is more complex than L1 in terms of memory requirements for machine realization, this task challenges students to compare the complexity of individual words from each language. Students are asked to propose a method to measure the complexity of a single word, using examples:
  - w1 = aaababaababaaabbaab (from L1)
  - w2 = aaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbb (from L2)

This part seeks to engage students in thinking critically about how complexity can be assessed not just at the language level but also at the level of individual string patterns.

### Overview
#### Topics Covered

#### 1. Regular Expressions:

- Students are tasked with providing examples and counterexamples for specific regular expressions, fostering a deeper understanding of language acceptance criteria defined by regular expressions.

#### 2. Creation of Regular Expressions:

- The homework includes exercises that require students to construct regular expressions for languages with specific properties, such as strings containing more than two '0's, strings that do not contain '01', and more.
